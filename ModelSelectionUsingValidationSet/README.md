**MODEL SELECTION USING VALIDATION SET**

**Description**

To avoid overfitting, model complexity can be automatically decided using a validation set. Regression algorithm is trained on a training data set and we measure the performance of trained machine learning algorithm on the validation set.Given a 2D dataset, the program decides which polynomial degree to use(n=1,2,3…20) to fit the validation data best by using error function. So it will automatically plot the error vs polynomial degree and prints which polynomial is best to use for our trained data.

**Installation**

You can install the polyfit.py and the data(data_training.txt and data_validation.txt). Once you put all these files in the same folder. You can install the necesary packages to run the code.

**Usage**

This code is written in Python3.6.
You should import `numpy` and `matplotlib` packages in order to run the code.These commands can work.

`pip install numpy`

`pip install matplotlib`
